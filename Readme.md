Modified blue, red and grey variant of the SuperRetroBoy theme for the Odroid Go Advance and it's derivatives. Theme is made for 480x320 resolution displays.

Credit belongs to Travis Wilson, I merely edited the mainmenu and game select images, but they were the original creator of all of the logo assets and xmls the theme is based on.
